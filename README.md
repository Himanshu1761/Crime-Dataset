# Crime-Dataset

# Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of the Crime Dataset, which consists of 39 rows and 9 columns. The dataset captures crime data across various states and union territories in India over the last three years. The analysis focuses on two major categories of crimes: IPC and SLL.

# Categories of Crimes
Indian Penal Code (IPC): A broad category encompassing various criminal offenses.
Special and Local Laws (SLL): Specific crimes framed by state governments, such as cybercrimes (e.g., phishing, spoofing, and credit card fraud).

# Key Points of Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the relationships between different variables and to gain insights into crime patterns.
Feature Engineering: Applied various techniques to enhance the dataset's features for better analysis.
Regional Analysis: Divided states into different regions to analyze crime rates regionally.
State-wise Comparison: Compared IPC and SLL crime rates across different states.
Handling Missing Values: Treated missing values using the median, as it is robust against outliers.
Outliers: Note that outliers were not treated in this dataset.

## This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns in India, highlighting regional disparities and the prevalence of different types of crimes.
